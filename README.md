🎮 Hangman Game

A simple implementation of the classic Hangman word-guessing game. The player tries to guess the hidden word one letter at a time. Each wrong guess brings the hangman closer to being "hanged." The game ends when the player either guesses the word correctly or the hangman is completed.

✨ Features

Random word selection from a predefined list.

Displays blanks and updates them as correct letters are guessed.

Tracks wrong guesses and remaining attempts.

ASCII art / graphical hangman representation (optional).

Replay option after game ends.

🚀 How to Play

The computer selects a random word.

The player guesses one letter at a time.

If the guess is correct → the letter is revealed in the word.

If the guess is wrong → a part of the hangman is drawn.

The game continues until:

The player guesses the full word ✅

OR the hangman is completely drawn ❌
